## Coding Patterns

2025-08-07: Feature implementation started: Making DiscoverMore section fully responsive and animated with Framer Motion. Will use motion.div for section and key blocks, entrance fade/slide effect, staggered animation for child elements, and responsive Tailwind classes for layout. Will validate animation and responsiveness and update memory after completion.
2025-08-07: Feature implementation started: Adding Framer Motion animation to SharedTeamHero section. Will use motion.div for section and key blocks, entrance fade/slide effect, staggered animation for child elements. 'use client' directive required for Next.js client-side rendering. Will validate animation and update memory after completion.
2025-08-07: UI enhancement applied: Updated ExploreByCategories.tsx to display category cards in responsive multi-column layout using Tailwind grid (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3). Cards now display in multiple columns on larger screens, fixing previous single-column issue. No errors found after implementation. Visual layout validated and memory updated.
2025-08-07: Bug investigation started: Poppins font rendering as serif instead of sans-serif. Will analyze font import, font-family usage, Tailwind config, and browser fallback. Will update memory after root cause is found and fixed.

- Data-driven rendering for pricing cards
- Responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
- Custom icons for feature lists
- Inline style for custom box-shadow
- Framer Motion for card animation
- Button always at the bottom using flex
- 'use client' directive required for animated client components
- Animate HomeImpact section and cards using Framer Motion entrance and stagger effects
- Mobile-friendly flex and centering classes applied to HomeFeatures sections (Broadcast, Chatbots, sharedTeam) for consistent responsive layout. Used max-sm:flex, max-sm:justify-center, max-sm:text-center, and responsive text sizing.

No Context7 research performed yet for pricing card width; all changes based on user design and direct feedback
2025-08-06: User requested to design pricing cards in PricingCards.tsx matching the provided screenshot, using existing colors, shadows, and CSS classes.
2025-08-06: Refactored pricing cards to be 340px wide, borderless, extracted all data to a single object, used the correct check icon, ensured text color and single-line layout match the design. All errors resolved and code is production-ready.
2025-08-06: User requested card width to be 390px on desktop, previously rendered as 320px. Card width now set to 390px at sm breakpoint and above.
Hover animations added to pricing cards using Framer Motion for scale and shadow effects (2025-08-06)

2025-08-06: User requested to make PayPerConversation section responsive and add Framer Motion animations. Context7 research required for latest best practices on responsive layouts and Framer Motion in Next.js/React.
2025-08-06: User requested to add Inter font as font-inter in Tailwind. Context7 search for 'Tailwind CSS add custom font Inter font-inter utility' returned no direct documentation. Proceeding with established best practices for custom font integration in Tailwind CSS (Google Fonts import, Tailwind config update, font-inter utility).

## Current Task (2025-08-07)

```

## Conversation History

2025-08-07: Enhanced TrendingBlogs section with scroll-triggered Framer Motion animation. Cards now animate as they enter the viewport using viewport prop and whileInView. Animation triggers only once per card. No errors found after implementation. Feature tested and confirmed for smooth scroll-based entrance.

2025-08-07: Framer Motion animation implemented for BlogeHero section. Used motion.section and motion.div for entrance and staggered fade/slide effects. Fixed TypeScript errors by importing and using Framer Motion's built-in 'easeInOut' easing function. No errors found after implementation. Animation tested and confirmed for functionality and performance.

2025-08-07: Framer Motion animation implemented for TrendingBlogs section. Used motion.section and motion.div for entrance and staggered fade/slide effects on blog cards. Cleaned up duplicate imports and ensured 'use client' directive is at the top. No errors found after implementation. Animation tested and confirmed for functionality and performance.

2025-08-07: Feature request received: Animate SharedTeamManagement section with Framer Motion in Next.js. Will use motion.div for section and key blocks, entrance fade/slide effect, staggered animation for child elements. Will validate animation and update memory after completion.

## Notes

- Always use framer-motion for UI animation
- Follow Tailwind and framer-motion conventions
- Feature implementation: testimonial cards now scale and shadow on hover (Testimonials.tsx)
- No errors found after implementation
- Next step: validate solution and check for any remaining problems
  2025-08-07: Feature Enhancement: Add subtle hover effect to category cards in ExploreByCategories.tsx, in addition to click effect. User wants the hover effect to be slight/subtle, not strong. File in focus: src/components/resources/blogs/ExploreByCategories.tsx. Plan: Update CategoryCard to include a smooth, minimal hover effect using Tailwind and/or framer-motion, test for visual appeal, and validate implementation.

## Current Task (2025-08-07)

2025-08-07: Feature Implementation & Enhancement: BroadcastFeatures section is now fully responsive and animated with Framer Motion. Used motion.section and motion.div for entrance and staggered child animations, Tailwind for mobile layout. All TypeScript errors resolved by removing 'ease' from variant transitions. Implementation tested and validated visually and in code. Solution matches requirements and is production-ready.
2025-08-07: Feature implementation started: Enhancing BroadcastFeatures.tsx with smooth scroll-based animation using Framer Motion. Will research best practices for scroll-triggered animation, update animation logic for smoothness, and validate with visual and code checks. Will update memory after each step.

2025-08-07: Feature implementation complete: Animated and made SolutionHero section responsive, matching BroadcastHero. Used Framer Motion for entrance and staggered child animation, Tailwind for responsive layout, and 'use client' directive for Next.js client-side rendering. Animation and responsiveness validated visually. Memory updated after implementation.

2025-08-07: UI enhancement started: Centering text on mobile in SolutionBrands.tsx. Will use Tailwind responsive text alignment classes (max-sm:text-center) for <h2> and <p> elements. Will validate on mobile and update memory after completion.
2025-08-07: UI enhancement complete: Centered <h2> and <p> text on mobile in SolutionBrands.tsx using max-sm:text-center Tailwind classes. No errors found after implementation. Visual result validated and memory updated.

2025-08-07: Feature implementation started: Animate SolutionCapabilities section with Framer Motion, add cool hover animation to cards. Will use motion.section for entrance animation, motion.div for cards, staggered child animation, and whileHover for scale/shadow effect. 'use client' directive required for Next.js client-side rendering. Will validate animation and update memory after completion.

2025-08-10: Feature implementation started: User requested scroll-based animation for cards in WhyChatiSpace.tsx. Will use Framer Motion's scroll-triggered animation (e.g., useInView or useAnimation) for each card. Will research best practices for scroll-based animation, update card rendering logic, and validate effect. Will update memory after completion.
2025-08-10: Context7 and official docs researched for framer-motion scroll animation. Best practice: useInView hook tracks when an element enters viewport. For each card, create a ref, use useInView, and trigger animation when isInView is true. Options: once (true for one-time animation), amount (how much of card must be visible), margin (custom detection area). Recommended: animate cards individually as they scroll into view, use stagger for smooth effect. Will implement this pattern in WhyChatiSpace.tsx.
